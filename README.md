Real-Time Stock Market Data Engineering Project Using Kafka

Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Stock Market Data Engineering Project, where we'll be building an end-to-end data pipeline to process and analyze stock market data in real-time using Apache Kafka and various other technologies.

Throughout this project, we'll leverage Python programming, Amazon Web Services (AWS) including S3, Athena, Glue, EC2, as well as Apache Kafka to create a robust and scalable data processing infrastructure.


Technologies Utilized
Programming Language: Python
Amazon Web Services (AWS):
S3 (Simple Storage Service): For storing raw and processed data.
Athena: To query data stored in S3 using SQL.
Glue Crawler: Automatically discovers and populates the Glue Catalog.
Glue Catalog: Central metadata repository for the Glue data catalog.
EC2: Used for hosting Kafka, allowing scalability and high availability.
Apache Kafka: Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and applications.

Dataset Considerations
While you can utilize any dataset for this project, our primary focus lies in the operational aspect of data engineering, specifically in constructing a robust and efficient data pipeline.
